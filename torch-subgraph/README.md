# 🔥 Torch Subgraph
> Subgraph for indexing the TorchPredictionMarket smart contract events on **Hedera**

This repository defines the GraphQL schema, event mappings, and configurations for indexing the `BetPlaced`, `BetFinalized`, `BetClainmed`, `FeeCollected`, `AggregationCompleted`, `BucketPriceSet`, and `BatchProcessed` events emitted by the Torch smart contracts.

## 🕸 Subgraph Overview

This subgraph indexes events related to prediction market lifecycle:

| Event                  | Description                                           |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `BetPlaced`            | Triggered when a user places a prediction bet         |
| `BetFinalized`         | Triggered when price is resolved and bets evaluated   |
| `BetClaimed`           | Triggered when a user claims their winnings           |
| `FeeCollected`         | Triggered when a fees is collected from a bet         |
| `AggregationComplted`  | Triggered when a bucket is resolved                   |
| `BucketPriceSet`       | Triggered when a bucket winnings price is set         |
| `BatchProcessed`       | Triggered when a bucket is processed                  |
